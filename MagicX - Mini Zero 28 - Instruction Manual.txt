- Theme color settings -
To add preferred colors to the theme, you need to have a basic understanding of JSON, 
as it is a JSON list that supports multiple objects.
To obtain the JSON list, first connect your device to your PC via Type-C. Navigate to:
My Computer > QUAD-CORE A133 aw4 > Internal Storage > Android > data > magic.mini.m > file > Config > json > ThemeColor.json.
If you want to reset it, simply delete ThemeColor.json, and Dawn will automatically recreate it.

- Adding a WALLPAPER for each platform -
Dawn supports adding wallpapers for each platform.
To add a wallpaper, please ensure your device is connected 
to your PC via Type-C. 
Navigate to:
This PC > QUAD-CORE A133 aw4 > Internal Shared Storage > Android > data> 
magic.mini.m > files > Config > EmulatorBackground.
In this directory, create a new folder and name it after each platform.
The wallpaper should be in JPG format, you can refer to the existing
default directories for guidance.
Once you have completed the above steps, you need to perform the following 
on your device:
Settings > Restart Dawn.

You will see your newly created folder in Settings > Platform Wallpaper Selection. 
Select it to switch to your custom platform wallpaper.
- CPU mode switch -
There are three places to switch CPU modes: Global, Platform, and Game.
Their priority is as follows: 
Game CPU Settings > Platform CPU Settings > Global Settings.
- SCREENSCRAPER -
SCREENSCRAPER is an API that allows you to download corresponding cover art 
for your local ROMs.
In simple terms, it offers both anonymous downloads and member downloads 
(you can register for free on their website). 
It is recommended to become a donor user, which only costs $10. This grants you 
a download speed of 2 MB/s and the ability to use 6 threads to download cover art.

You can register for free at this website: www.screenscraper.fr
- Overlay Directory Management -
The overlay feature is currently only available for RetroArch. 
Here’s how to add overlays for the platform.
First, go to Dawn Settings > Overlay Directory Settings. Once you select a directory, 
Dawn will automatically create a directory named "RaOverlay" within that folder. 
It will generate corresponding platform names, and you just need to place the cfg overlay 
configuration files and png overlay images in the respective platform directories. 
You will then be able to select the overlays you placed in the platform overlay settings.
- Game Directory Management -
Dawn supports adding multiple game directory paths, and it will create a directory named "ROMS" 
in the selected directory. When you place the corresponding game ROMs in the directory, 
it will automatically scan and recognize the game ROMs, and it will create a Games.json 
configuration file in the ROMS directory. You can modify the corresponding Chinese name for each ROM.

WARNING:
When you need to delete a ROM, the Games.json file will also delete the information corresponding 
to that ROM. 
If necessary, please back it up before deleting the ROM.


== PLATFORM AND GAME SETTINGS ==
- Platform/Game Core Switch -
Dawn allows you to freely select the corresponding RetroArch core or standalone emulator 
for each platform/game.
It’s important to note:
Game Core Settings > Platform Core Settings.
If you encounter issues like a black screen, switching cores is the right choice. 
Selecting the appropriate core will enhance your gaming experience and make it smoother.
- Individual Game Screen Orientation Switch -
Dawn supports the ability to switch the screen orientation for each game (available only for RetroArch).
When you need to play vertical games, such as vertical shooters, selecting this feature is the right choice. 
It will automatically rotate the screen to vertical mode after you start the game and configure the correct 
controls for vertical gameplay.
== ADDING GAMES ==
Adding games in Dawn is a very simple process. First, ensure that your device is connected 
to the PC using a Type-C cable.
The following is an example of the default ROMs directory path:
This PC > QUAD-CORE A133 aw4 > Internal Storage > ROMS. In this path, you can see many folders named 
after the platforms. 
Simply place the corresponding ROM files into the appropriate platform folder.
To find out the supported file extensions for each platform, 
please refer to the "EmulatorConfig.json" configuration file in the assets.
