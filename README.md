# About Dawn

Dawn is a retro frontend that heavily references Daijishou look and feel, tweaked for our devices to provide more scalability in our future. Currently, it\'s in its infancy. In the future, we will continue to work hard on updates based on feedback from people in the community and our own experiences with retro games.

# origin of name

The name Dawn is inspired by the darkness before dawn, symbolizing the emergence of light from silence, heralding a moment of brightness.

# Supported devices

It focuses on device support for Magicx, and while other devices will work, I don't guarantee it will work.
